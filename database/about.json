  "My passion for robotics began in high school, where I competed in FIRST Robotics competitions and was captivated by seeing the robots I designed come to life and perform as intended. This early experience fueled my journey through a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech, and I am now pursuing a Master’s at Stanford, focusing on Robotics.",
  
  "I've had the opportunity to work across diverse environments, from start-ups to large manufacturing companies, with my most recent experience as a Mechanical Engineering Intern at Draper Laboratory. Currently, I'm working in Stanford’s Assistive Robotics and Manipulation Lab, where I am improving dexterous robot teleoperation by integrating visual-tactile feedback for more intuitive control.",
  
  "When I'm not working on robotics, you can usually find me enjoying video games or the outdoors. I love hiking, climbing, and traveling, and have been passionate about climbing since my college days."
